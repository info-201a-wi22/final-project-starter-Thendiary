# The `\data` Directory: Project Data Summary

In our project, we use the following data files and Application Programming Interfaces:

### Data files (TODO: Update/delete)
|Data File Name | Brief Description|
|---------------| -----------------|
|[Fatal Vehicle crashes](./Carccident/"Fatal vehicle crashes"/) | This folder contains fatal Motor vehicle accidents data from 1975 to 2019 collected by United States Department of Transportation. We will emphasize analyzing the data between 2017 and 2019.(This a kind of conclusion created by United States Department of Transportation) (See report for details.)
|[US_Accident_Kaggle](./Carccident/US_Accident_Kaggle/) | This folder contains datasets published by Sobhan Moosavi, describing the dataset which covers 49 states of the United States. The data is continuously being collected from February 2016, using several data providers. But we only analyzing the data between 2017 and 2019.
|[Fatal Motor Vehicle Accidents](./Carccident/Fatality_Analysis_Vehicle.csv) | This file contains fatal motor vehicle accidents data divided by years. This is a specified dataset.

### Application Programming Interfaces (API) (TODO: Update/delete)

* **New York Times Books API**. The _New York Times_ provides data for Best
Sellers lists and the books that have been reviewed in the New York Times. An overview of the API that we use in our project is available here: [Books API](https://developer.nytimes.com/docs/books-product/1/overview). For more about developing apps with New York Times data see: [NYTimes Developers](https://developer.nytimes.com/).

# NOTE 1: About the `/data` Directory

* Use the `/data` directory to store any data that you using in your project (for example, CSV files)
* Edit this `README.md` file and summarize your data files
* If you are using APIs to access data, summarize them, providing specific information
* See examples above.

# NOTE 2:  Clear and Concise Documentation
* Please remember your audience (prospective employers, open source colleagues, TAs, Instructors). Therefore,
aim for clarity and conciseness.
* When done, be sure to delete these NOTE sections and the example CSV file (which are intended for you, of course, not your audience!)
